# **MY PYTHON LEARNING JOURNEY**

## **OVERVIEW**

This document summarizes my learning progress in Python programming. I have been focusing on foundational concepts and data structures to build a solid understanding of the language. 

## **TOPICS COVERED**

### **1. Python Basics**
- **Data Types**: Explored various data types, including integers, floats, strings, and booleans.
- **Operators**: Learned how to use arithmetic and comparison operators.
- **Control Structures**: Understood how to implement decision-making using if statements and how to iterate using loops (for and while).

### **2. Functions**
- **Defining Functions**: Created reusable blocks of code to perform specific tasks.
- **Parameters and Return Values**: Learned how to pass data to functions and return results.

### **3. Data Structures**
- **Lists**: Created and manipulated lists to store collections of items.
- **Tuples**: Understood the characteristics and usage of immutable sequences.
- **Dictionaries**: Gained experience in working with key-value pairs.

## **FUTURE PLANS**

As I take a pause in my Python learning journey, I look forward to continuing in the future. My goal is to delve deeper into advanced concepts and expand my understanding of Python programming.
